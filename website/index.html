                <div class="well"><p>Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. Formed in 1996, the band rose to international fame with their debut album Hybrid Theory (2000), which was certified diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-platinum in several other countries.  Their following studio album Meteora continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work around the world.  In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium.  Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart.  In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared as the Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now by <a href="http://www.kerrang.com"  onClick="return confirm('Continue to Kerrang! ?')">Kerrang!</a>.</p>

								<p>Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band explored other genres in their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight (2007).  The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third-best debut week of any album that year.  The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types in their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds and beats. Their fifth album, Living Things (2012), combines musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound. Their upcoming album One More Light is expected to be released May 19, 2017. The band has collaborated with several other artists, including rapper Jay Z in their mashup EP Collision Course, and many others on the remix albums Reanimation and Recharged. Linkin Park has sold over 70 million albums worldwide and has won two Grammy Awards.</p>

							<h2 class="origins">Before the fame</h2><p>Linkin Park was founded by three high school friends: <a href="band.html">Mike Shinoda</a>, <a href="band.html">Rob Bourdon</a>, and <a href="band.html">Brad Delson</a>. The three attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. After graduating from high school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting <a href="band.html">Joe Hahn</a>, <a href="band.html">Dave "Phoenix" Farrell</a>, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, Xero. Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda's makeshift bedroom studio in 1996, resulting in a four-track demo tape, entitled Xero. Tensions and frustration within the band grew however after they failed to land a record deal. The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at that time the band's vocalist, to leave the band in search of other projects. Farrell also left to tour with Tasty Snax, a Christian punk and ska band</p>

			        <p>After spending a considerable time searching for Wakefield's replacement, Xero recruited Arizona vocalist <a href="band.html">Chester Bennington</a>, who was recommended by Jeff Blue, the vice president of Zomba Music in March 1999. Bennington became a standout among applicants because of the dynamic in his singing style. The band then agreed on changing its name from Xero to Hybrid Theory; the newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them to work on new material.  In 1999 the band released a self-titled extended play, which they circulated across internet chat-rooms and forums with the help of an online 'street team'.</p> <p>The band's renaissance culminated with a change in name; from Hybrid Theory this time to Linkin Park, a play on and homage to Santa Monica's Lincoln Park. The band initially wanted to use the name "Lincoln Park", however they changed it to "Linkin" to acquire the internet domain <a href="https://linkinpark.com">linkinpark.com</a>. The band still struggled to sign a record deal. Linkin Park turned to Jeff Blue for additional help after facing numerous rejections from several major record labels. After failing to catch Warner Bros. Records on three previous reviews, Jeff Blue, now the vice president of Warner Bros. Records, helped the band sign a deal with the company in 1999. The band released its breakthrough album, Hybrid Theory, the following year. This release represented half a decade’s worth of the band’s work. Hybrid Theory was a massive commercial success; it sold more than 4.8 million copies during its debut year, earning it the status of best-selling album of 2001 and propelled them to commercial stardom.</p>
